        description: 'We\'re using hemp to advance sustainable agricutlural practices and train Indigenous and BPOC women to participate in the hemp industry. This creates climate resilience, while addressing social, politcal and economic equity in the industry. "Native American reconciliation with the United States, ecological restoration of our broken ecosystems, and real social justice are inseparable. Modern society is disconnected from other life on the planet and is built on a human first (church based) narrative that replaced thousands of years of native wisdom. As our fragile ecosystems collapse around us, Native philosophies have the potential to share a new type of thinking that is needed by modern society to understand and respect nature and other life forms. To do this Indigenous people must be given the opportunity to come back to the landscapes and regions across North America and share wisdom, history, and vision for a better future. Without this our collective approach to addressing social justice and the climate crisis will be flawed and ineffective. Founded by Alicia Fall (Eastern Band Tsalagi/Cuban Taino), Her Many Voices Foundation is an Indigenous led, holacracy managed nonprofit, providing education and resources concerning issues around women, children and Mother Earth, since 2009. Our idea, for this project, is to promote the development of green businesses and jobs for Indigenous women by acquiring land on which we will create Hemp Education Cultural Center Longhouses - New York being the first of its kind. We\'re using hemp to advance sustainable agricultural practices and train Indigenous and BPOC women to participate in the hemp industry. We do this to create climate resilience, while addressing social, political, and economic equity in the industry."',

The kits will include seeds, pots, fertilizer, soil, and instructions. We are growing native heirloom, GMO-free seeds from native seed banks, donations from community members, and various native organizations. We hope to establish a thriving native heirloom seed library to feed our local native communities and share our precious seeds with other native communities. Ms Francis is providing phone and online support during the Coronavirus for all participants.

Indigenous permaculture is based on the philosophy and techniques of shared Indigenous ancient agricultural knowledge encompassing a balance of natural laws of mother earth. Contemporary Permaculture means permanent agriculture or culture, caring for Earth, People and Community, and sharing overabundance. Indigenous Permaculture weaves traditional ecological knowledge with innovative science. Our sessions highlight the following:\n• Community service learning skills\n• Connecting and healing with the soil and natural world utilizing all five senses\n• Encouraging People, Earth and Land stewardship\n• Instilling youth leadership values and lessons\n• Utilizing science, math and various art forms of expression\n• Encouraging healthier eating with traditional indigenous super foods\n• Learning full cycle planting, seedling identification, caretaking of plants, harvesting of produce and seed preservation.',

Teaches individuals tools for emotional regulation Teaches tools of social connection and empathy Helps with overcoming habits and additions Helps individuals deal with trauma.\nRefugees who are victims of trauma including natural disaster, human-inflicted violence, or trauma as a result of displacement, suffer devastating physical, emotional, and social health consequences, but often have little or no access to mental health services that can help them deal with and recover from their loss or tragedy.\nIn the past five years, Denver area refugee services have seen a dramatic increase in cases arriving with severe and persistent mental health needs including unresolved trauma resulting in Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome Disorder (PTSD). These disorders create barriers to assimilation into the American culture, ability to learn English, and ability to find and maintain employment.\nWorking in concert with the Neurosculpting® Institute, Her Many Voices Foundation has launched its “Refugee Ambassador” program, training refugee women from various refugee populations, including Indigenous women, in techniques of stress and trauma relief. Upon completion of this 9-month Neurosculpting® certification program, these refugee women will become “Ambassadors” for the program, training groups of women of their own nationality, teaching other traumatized women techniques to retrain stress patterns, and lowering the social and psychological effects of trauma.\nThe goals of this program are to educate these Ambassadors to teach trauma-based Neurosculpting® exercises and lifestyle practices to those in need who have suffered from sex trafficking, domestic violence, institutional violence, genocide, rape, and mental, emotional and physical trauma.\nWe believe the cost to send our Ambassadors through the full completion of this program should not be a deterrent to the healing and support these traumatized communities desperately need. Your generous donations are helping to change individual lives and communities.\nCurrent domestic communities served by these Ambassadors include:\n • Denver-based assimilating refugee communities,\n•Indigenous Nation communities and\n•Impoverished Latin-American immigrant communities.\nCurrent global communities served by these Ambassadors include:\n•Nigeria\n•Eritrea\n•Ethiopia\n•Somalia\n•Sudan\n•Libya\n•Haiti\n•Latin America\n•Native Nations\nYour funds are paying for 80% of the tuition and education supplies for each woman, plus international travel and housing for non US-based Ambassadors.\nAll donations are tax-deductible.\nLearn more about the Neurosculpting® Institute',

In an area as destitute as Trou ChouChou where parents can\'t pay to tuition, it is often impossible for communities to pay salaries to attract and retain teachers. Inability to attend school is especially hard on the many Trou ChouChou children who are undernourished or malnourished, as the daily meal provided at school is more than just a supplement - it is often the only meal a child will receive during the day!\n',
